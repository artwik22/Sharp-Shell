## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artwik22/sharpshell.git ~/.config/sharpshell
cd ~/.config/sharpshell
```

### 2. Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x *.sh
```

### 3. Configure Quickshell

Make sure Quickshell is configured to use `shell.qml` as the main configuration file. The path should point to:

```
~/.config/sharpshell/shell.qml
```

Create the wallpapers directory (or change the path in `AppLauncher.qml`):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Wallpapers
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts Configuration

> **Important:** You need to bind keyboard shortcuts in your Wayland compositor (e.g., Hyprland) to launch the scripts.

#### For Hyprland (`~/.config/hyprland/hyprland.conf`)

```ini
# Open Launcher
bind = SUPER, R, exec, ~/.config/sharpshell/open-launcher.sh

# Toggle Dashboard
bind = SUPER, M, exec, ~/.config/sharpshell/toggle-menu.sh
```

#### For other compositors

Configure similar bindings to execute the scripts from `~/.config/sharpshell/`.

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Inside Launcher/Dashboard)

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| **Open Launcher** | `Super+R` (or your configured shortcut) |
| **Toggle Dashboard** | `Super+M` (or your configured shortcut) |
| **Navigate** | Arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) |
| **Select** | `Enter` or `Space` |
| **Search** | Start typing to filter (in launcher) |
| **Web Search** | Type `!` followed by query, then press `Enter` |
| **Execute Command** | Type `@` followed by command, then press `Enter` |
| **Calculate** | Type `=` followed by expression, then press `Enter` (copies result to clipboard) |
| **Tab Navigation** | Click tabs or use mouse to switch between Dashboard, Media, and Performance tabs |
| **Close** | `Escape` |

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors and Styling

SharpShell includes a powerful color customization system:

- **24 Color Presets**: Choose from beautiful pre-made themes
  - Dark, Ocean, Forest, Violet, Crimson, Amber, Teal, Rose, Sunset, Midnight, Emerald, Lavender, Sapphire, Coral, Mint, Plum, Gold, Monochrome, Cherry, Azure, Jade, Ruby, Indigo
- **Custom HEX Colors**: Edit individual color values (Background, Primary, Secondary, Text, Focus/Accent)
- **Live Preview**: See changes instantly as you edit
- **Persistent Settings**: Colors are saved to `~/.config/sharpshell/colors.json`

#### Customizing QML Files

Edit the QML files in `components/` to customize:
- Font sizes and families
- Border radius and spacing
- Animation durations and easing

### Layout and Sizing

| Component | Customization |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Launcher Size** | Modify `implicitWidth` and `implicitHeight` in `AppLauncher.qml` |
| **Wallpaper Grid** | Adjust `cellWidth` and `cellHeight` in wallpaper picker |
| **Dashboard Size** | Change dimensions in `Dashboard.qml` (default: 840x420) |
| **Tab Content** | Customize card layouts and sizes in respective tab sections |
| **Resource Bars** | Adjust bar heights and animation speeds |
| **Media Player** | Modify album art size and control button dimensions |

### Behavior

- **Animation Speed**: Adjust `duration` in `Behavior` and `NumberAnimation` blocks
- **Hover Effects**: Modify `scale` values in hover handlers
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Configure in your compositor settings

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Wallpapers Path

**Default path:** `~/Pictures/Wallpapers`

To change, edit in `AppLauncher.qml`:

```qml
property string wallpapersPath: "/your/custom/path"
```

> **Note:** SharpShell uses native Quickshell wallpaper system (no external tools required!). The wallpaper is set via `WallpaperBackground.qml` component using `WlrLayer.Background`. If you prefer external tools, SharpShell will automatically detect and use `swww`, `wbg`, or `hyprpaper` if available.

### Audio Visualizer

The visualizer uses `cava` with automatic configuration. To customize, edit `scripts/start-cava.sh`. The Dashboard Media tab includes a full-width Cava visualizer that works alongside the side panel visualizer.

### GPU Monitoring

The Dashboard automatically detects and uses the appropriate GPU monitoring tool:

| GPU Vendor | Tool Used |
|------------|-----------|
| **NVIDIA** | `nvidia-smi` to query GPU utilization |
| **AMD** | `radeontop` to query GPU utilization |
| **Intel** | `intel_gpu_top` to query GPU utilization |

> Falls back gracefully if no compatible tool is found.

### Package Management

Scripts support both Pacman and AUR (via `yay` or `paru`). Make sure you have an AUR helper installed.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Launcher Not Appearing

- ✅ Check Quickshell configuration
- ✅ Verify `shell.qml` path is correct
- ✅ Check keyboard shortcut binding

### Visualizer Not Working

- ✅ Ensure `cava` is installed: `sudo pacman -S cava`
- ✅ Check if `/tmp/quickshell_cava` is being created
- ✅ Verify PulseAudio is running
- ✅ For Dashboard Media tab visualizer, ensure cava is running via the side panel or start it manually

### GPU Monitoring Not Working

| GPU Type | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **NVIDIA** | Ensure `nvidia-smi` is available (usually comes with nvidia drivers) |
| **AMD** | Install `radeontop`: `sudo pacman -S radeontop` |
| **Intel** | Install `intel-gpu-tools`: `sudo pacman -S intel-gpu-tools` |

> The Dashboard will automatically detect and use the appropriate tool.

### Wallpapers Not Loading

- ✅ Check wallpapers directory exists
- ✅ Verify file permissions
- ✅ Wallpapers work natively through Quickshell (no external tools needed!)
- ✅ If using external tools, ensure `swww`, `wbg`, or `hyprpaper` is installed

### Keyboard Focus Issues

- ✅ Try clicking on the launcher window
- ✅ Check Wayland compositor focus settings
